# Vid2Ascii
***
This project was mainly so I can learn Rust. This program takes any video and converts it to a (right now only) black and white ASCII animation. 

## Future Goals:
- Speeding up Frame Generation
- Generating MP4's
- Adding Color Support
- Ability to generate 1:1 animations (one character per pixel)

## How to Run
`cargo run `
